    "**What Shifts:**\n",
    "- From: M1.2 — Data Governance & PII Protection\n",
    "- To: M1.3 — Multi-Framework Intelligence (Regulatory Frameworks Deep Dive)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Bridge Matters:**\n",
    "Moving from single-framework compliance (GDPR) to multi-framework intelligence (GDPR + SOC 2 + ISO 27001 + HIPAA) is the difference between ₹12-15L RAG engineering roles and ₹24-30L compliance architecture positions. This bridge validates you understand the strategic shift from \"implement privacy controls\" to \"architect simultaneous multi-regulatory compliance.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Impact:** A Hyderabad GCC serving 60 business units incurred ₹1.8 crores ($2.2M) remediation cost through 8-month delays attempting single-framework-at-a-time retrofitting. M1.3 teaches you to architect for multiple frameworks simultaneously from day one.\n",

    "**New Concepts in M1.3:**\n",
    "- **Compliance Framework Mapper Architecture** — Parallel 4-framework analyzers running simultaneously\n",
    "- **GDPR Analysis Engine** — 7 principles, 8 data subject rights, €20M fine exposure assessment\n",
    "- **SOC 2 Analyzer** — 5 Trust Service Criteria, 64 points of focus, Type I vs Type II audit preparation\n",
    "- **ISO 27001 Compliance Scanner** — 93 Annex A controls, 14 control categories, ISMS framework integration\n",
    "- **HIPAA Security Assessor** — Security Rule compliance, BAA requirements, 60-day breach notification, $50K-per-violation penalties\n",
    "- **Overlap Mapping Technology** — Reducing 400+ controls to ~150 through intelligent framework overlap detection\n",
    "- **Gap Prioritization Engine** — Risk-weighted scoring (penalty exposure × business impact × implementation effort)\n",
    "- **Automated Audit Report Generator** — Framework-specific documentation in auditor-expected formats\n",
    "- **Tenant-Aware Compliance Profiles** — Per-tenant framework coverage for 50+ business units\n",
    "\n",
    "**Building On:**\n",
    "- M1.2 established: GDPR-compliant data governance with PII detection (Microsoft Presidio), anonymization, and retention policies\n",
    "- M1.3 extends: From single-framework compliance to simultaneous multi-regulatory intelligence across 4 major frameworks"
