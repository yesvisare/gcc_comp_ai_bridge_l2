Purpose\n\n**What Shifts:**\n- From: M1.3 — Regulatory Frameworks Deep Dive\n- To: M1.4 — Compliance Documentation & Evidence\n\n**Why This Bridge Matters:**\n\nYou just built a Compliance Framework Mapper that analyzes RAG architectures against four major frameworks simultaneously (GDPR, SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA). Your system identifies gaps and generates remediation roadmaps.\n\nBut here's the critical problem: **You can assess compliance, but can you prove it to auditors?**\n\nIn 2023, a mid-sized SaaS company failed their SOC 2 Type II audit—not because they lacked security controls, but because they couldn't provide 12 months of evidence proving those controls worked. The consequence: Material weakness finding, ₹50 lakh remediation cost, and lost enterprise contracts worth ₹2 crore annually.\n\nThis bridge validates you understand the gap between *compliance assessment* (what M1.3 delivers) and *audit evidence* (what M1.4 will build).\n\n**Bridge Type:** Readiness Validation",

Concepts Covered\n\n**New Concepts in M1.4:**\n\n- **Immutable Audit Trails** — Cryptographically linked log entries using SHA-256 hash chaining (like blockchain for compliance logs)\n- **Automated Evidence Collection** — Scheduled pipelines that export compliance evidence continuously (daily snapshots, weekly exports)\n- **Evidence Organization by Framework** — Structured storage mapping to specific regulations (SOX_Controls/, SOC2_Criteria/, ISO27001_Controls/, GDPR_Articles/)\n- **Cryptographic Log Integrity** — Mathematical proof that audit logs haven't been tampered with (satisfies SOX Section 404 requirements)\n- **Compliance Documentation Repository** — Version-controlled policies and procedures mapped to regulatory requirements\n- **Vendor Risk Assessment** — Structured evaluation of third-party compliance posture (OpenAI, Pinecone, AWS)\n- **Audit Report Generation** — Automated creation of framework-specific audit reports in under 60 seconds\n- **S3 Object Lock** — AWS immutability guarantees for compliance evidence storage\n\n**Building On:**\n\n- M1.3 established: Multi-framework compliance assessment capability\n- M1.4 extends: Adding mathematically provable evidence layer that auditors can trust",

Automated Evidence Collection Pipelines**\n- Scheduled jobs that export evidence continuously (no more scrambling when auditors ask)\n- Daily log snapshots, weekly configuration exports\n- Organized by compliance framework (SOX_Controls/, SOC2_Criteria/, ISO27001_Controls/, GDPR_Articles/)\n- S3 Object Lock for immutability\n- Generate audit reports for any date range in 60 seconds\n\n**3. Compliance Documentation Repository**\n- Version-controlled policies, procedures, and system documentation\n- Mapped to specific regulatory requirements\n- Every change tracked (who changed what policy, when, why)\n- MkDocs generates searchable documentation site\n\n**4. Vendor Risk Assessment Framework**\n- Structured assessment of third-party AI vendors (OpenAI, Pinecone, AWS)\n- Quantitative scoring with annual reassessment workflows\n- Automated mitigation recommendations\n\n---\n\n## Why You're Ready\n\nYour M1.3 Compliance Framework Mapper gives you the **assessment layer** (what controls you need).\n\nM1.4 completes the stack with the **evidence layer** (proof controls work).\n\n**The Compliance Intelligence Stack:**\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ M1.4: Evidence & Proof              │ ← You're building this next\n│ (Immutable trails, automated        │\n│  collection, cryptographic proof)   │\n├─────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ M1.3: Assessment & Analysis         │ ← You just built this\n│ (4-framework mapper, gap analysis)  │\n└─────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\nThink of it this way:\n- **M1.3 is your compliance roadmap** (where you need to go)\n- **M1.4 is your GPS with dashcam** (proving you actually went there)\n\nAuditors don't trust roadmaps—they trust dashcam footage.
