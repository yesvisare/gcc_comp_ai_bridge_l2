    "**What Shifts:**\n",
    "- **From:** M1.4 — Compliance Documentation & Evidence\n",
    "- **To:** M2.1 — Authentication & Identity Management\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Bridge Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "M1.4 established sophisticated evidence collection systems using immutable audit trails, automated logging to S3, and git-based compliance documentation. The focus was on *proving what happened after the fact*.\n",
    "\n",
    "M2.1 shifts to enterprise authentication via OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect, multi-factor authentication, and tenant isolation enforcement. The paradigm changes to *preventing unauthorized access before it occurs*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical Gap:** Sophisticated audit trails become worthless if anyone can impersonate authenticated users. A real 2022 case study illustrates this: a Bangalore GCC lost a $3.2 million contract due to SOC 2 audit failure on identity verification, requiring 6-month remediation.\n",

    "\n",
    "**New Concepts in M2.1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect** — Enterprise Identity Provider integration for secure authentication flows\n",
    "- **JWT Token Management** — Token validation, expiration handling, and refresh mechanisms\n",
    "- **Multi-Tenant Identity Isolation** — Enforcement of tenant boundaries at authentication layer\n",
    "- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** — TOTP and hardware token implementation for enhanced security\n",
    "- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** — 4 standard roles plus custom per-tenant role definitions\n",
    "- **Session Security** — IP validation, User-Agent fingerprinting, concurrent session limits\n",
    "\n",
    "**Building On:**\n",
    "- **M1.4 established:** Immutable audit trails, evidence collection, compliance documentation systems\n",
    "- **M2.1 extends:** Adds preventive controls through authentication, moving from \"prove what happened\" to \"prevent unauthorized access\""
