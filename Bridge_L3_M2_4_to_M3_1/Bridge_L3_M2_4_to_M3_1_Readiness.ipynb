    "**Why This Bridge Matters:**\n",

    "You've built comprehensive security testing in M2.4 (STRIDE threat models, SAST/DAST pipelines, prompt injection defenses, security gates). Now you need to **prove continuous compliance** to auditors.\n",

    "- **Policy-as-Code (OPA):** Codifying compliance rules in Open Policy Agent for automated evaluation across 50+ tenants\n",
    "- **Executive Compliance Dashboards:** Real-time Grafana visualization of compliance posture for CFO/Board visibility\n",
    "- **SOC2 Control Mapping:** Direct traceability from technical controls to Trust Service Criteria (CC1-CC9)\n",
    "- **Automated Evidence Generation:** On-demand audit-ready report exports (5 minutes vs. 40 hours manual compilation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Building On:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- M2.4 established: Security testing frameworks (SAST, DAST, threat modeling, security gates)\n",
