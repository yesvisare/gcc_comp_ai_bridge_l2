Reach out to support@techvoyagehub.com\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. ✅ Ensure **ALL 3 checks passed** (✓)\n2. ➡️ Proceed to **M3.3: Audit Logging & SIEM Integration**\n3. 🔖 Reference this bridge if you get stuck on \"Why are we building this?\"\n\n**After M3.3:** You'll have the immutable audit trail that makes M3.4 (Compliance Incident Response) possible — because you can't investigate breaches without tamper-proof logs.",

   "source": "## Recap: What You Built in M3.2\n\nIn M3.2, you implemented **policy-as-code with OPA (Open Policy Agent)** — writing compliance requirements as executable, testable code instead of documentation that drifts.\n\n**Key Deliverables:**\n\n1. **16+ Automated Compliance Tests** covering:\n   - PII detection with >99% accuracy\n   - Access control enforcement (zero cross-tenant leaks)\n   - Audit log completeness (99.5%+ coverage)\n   - Data retention policies (SOX/GDPR compliance)\n\n2. **CI/CD Integration** using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI:\n   - Every commit triggers automated compliance validation\n   - Failed tests **block deployments** before reaching production\n   - **95%+ prevention rate** for compliance violations\n\n3. **Automated Compliance Evidence Generation:**\n   - Test results, policies, and coverage reports packaged for auditors\n   - Audit prep time reduced from **8 hours → 30 minutes**\n\n**The Achievement:**\n\nYou shifted from **reactive** compliance (detecting violations after they happen) to **proactive** compliance (preventing violations before production). Your CI/CD pipeline now enforces that compliance controls work on every deployment.\n\n**The Gap This Bridge Addresses:**\n\nYour M3.2 tests validate that compliance controls are working. But they *assume* you've already built production-grade audit logging. Most tests check \"Are audit logs complete?\" — but **what if the audit logs themselves aren't production-ready?** (mutable storage, no SIEM, deleted after 30 days, etc.)",
