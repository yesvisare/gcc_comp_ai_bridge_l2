   "source": "## Call-Forward: What's Next in M4.1\n\n**Module M4.1 Will Cover:**\n- **10-Section Model Cards** — Creating comprehensive RAGModelCard documentation covering intended use, training data, performance metrics, known limitations, ethical considerations, and governance processes. This becomes the \"nutrition label\" for your AI system.\n- **Automated Bias Detection** — Implementing RAGBiasDetector class to test demographic parity across user groups (regions, departments, seniority levels) and flag fairness disparities automatically.\n- **Human-in-the-Loop Workflows** — Building HITLWorkflowManager to route high-stakes queries (legal, financial, personnel decisions) to human reviewers instead of auto-responding, with approval audit trails.\n- **Governance Committee Structure** — Establishing formal oversight with Security, Legal, Privacy, Product, and Engineering representatives, quarterly reviews, and change approval workflows.\n- **NIST AI RMF + EU AI Act Compliance** — Mapping your governance to NIST's GOVERN, MAP, MEASURE, MANAGE functions and EU AI Act Article 13 requirements for high-risk AI systems.\n\n**Why You're Ready:**\nYou have the reactive foundation (M3.4 incident response) that catches failures after they occur. Now you'll build the proactive layer (M4.1 governance) that prevents failures before deployment through documentation, bias testing, and human oversight. Together, these satisfy CFOs (ROI: ₹9.2L cost vs ₹22 crore fine risk), Compliance Officers (both EU AI Act and GDPR requirements), and CTOs (production-ready systems with documented limitations).\n\n**What to Expect:**\n- **Duration:** 90-120 minutes (conceptual video + PractaThon implementation)\n- **Complexity:** Intermediate - You'll build 3 core classes (RAGModelCard, RAGBiasDetector, HITLWorkflowManager) with PostgreSQL integration\n- **Key deliverables:** Complete model card JSON, automated bias testing reports, human review queue system with audit trails\n\n**If You're Not Ready:**\n- Review M3.4 materials to complete incident response infrastructure\n- Ensure all 4 checks above passed (✓)\n- Install missing packages (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)\n- Reach out for support: support@techvoyagehub.com\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Ensure ALL checks passed (✓)\n2. Proceed to **M4.1: Model Cards & AI Governance**\n3. Reference this bridge if stuck on reactive vs. proactive concepts\n\n**Career Impact:**\nSenior RAG engineers with complete governance expertise (M3 reactive + M4 proactive) command ₹18-28 lakhs, especially in GCCs serving regulated industries. This isn't just compliance—it's career differentiation.",
