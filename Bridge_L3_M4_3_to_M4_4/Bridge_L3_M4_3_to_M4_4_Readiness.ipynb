    "**What Shifts:**\n",
    "- From: M4.3 \u2014 Change Management & Compliance\n",
    "- To: M4.4 \u2014 Compliance Maturity & Continuous Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Bridge Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You've built a production-grade Change Management System with 6-phase workflows, CAB approval, automated rollback, and immutable audit trails. You can prove to auditors that every change is controlled and documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "But three critical questions remain:\n",
    "- **CFO asks:** \"We've spent \u20b950 lakh on compliance. Are we getting *better* or just spending more?\"\n",
    "- **Auditors ask:** \"What's your compliance maturity level? Show us your improvement roadmap.\"\n",
    "- **CTO asks:** \"How do we prioritize compliance improvements when we have limited resources?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Without maturity assessment, you have *compliance systems* but can't prove *continuous improvement*. This bridge validates you're ready to build the capstone: a **Compliance Maturity Assessment & Improvement System** that measures, tracks, and proves organizational progress.\n",
